        <p>I enjoy writing my own bio as much as the next person. I'd rather look forward. But we can run over a few things. I came over to the U.S. from Thailand and grew up in Texas, The Lone Star State. I know Texas invokes different images into people's heads, but to me I had a great combination of the big city while able to get lost down in the bayou and getting good and dirty. I did enjoy the Friday Night Lights. Richard Milhouse Nixon was the President when I came over. Growning up in Texas, you have to take 2 years of Texas History in school. From that I learned that the Mockingbird is the State Bird of Texas, and that if you're asked about Texas history, it's a safe bet to answer Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, or Stephen F. Austin. The later is easy to remember because the named the State Capitol after him. The answer is never Santa Anna. It took some time, but I do accept that Texas is not the largest state in the Union. I currently live in the Seattle Area with my wife, Cynthia, three dogs, and a few fish. Before COVID, I was a fan of cinima. I grew up on war films from the classics of WWII, to Stripes and Platoon, and more recent ones such as Zero Dark Thirty and 13 Hours. I also like plety of the mainstream films, but there was a phase where they all had to dark and brooding with lots of teenage angst. Good thing I outgrew all that...
